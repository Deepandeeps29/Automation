CI/CD Pipeline Roadmap to Study
🔰 1. Basics of CI/CD
What is CI (Continuous Integration)?

What is CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)?

Benefits of using CI/CD

Common CI/CD pipeline stages: build, test, deploy

🧰 2. Version Control Systems (VCS)
Learn Git basics: clone, commit, push, pull, branch, merge

Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

Git workflows: GitFlow, trunk-based development

⚙️ 3. CI/CD Tools
Learn at least one:
GitHub Actions (best for GitHub projects)

Jenkins (most popular, highly customizable)

GitLab CI/CD

CircleCI / Travis CI / Azure DevOps

🏗️ 4. Pipeline Fundamentals
Understand pipeline structure: YAML or Groovy (Jenkins)

Define pipeline stages: build → test → package → deploy

Automate:

Unit testing

Code linting

Build & compile

Artifact storage (e.g., JAR, Docker images)

🧪 5. Testing Integration
Types of tests: Unit, Integration, E2E

Tools:

Python → pytest

Java → JUnit

JavaScript → Jest/Mocha

Code quality tools: SonarQube, ESLint

📦 6. Artifact Management
Store build artifacts:

DockerHub

Nexus

JFrog Artifactory

🐳 7. Docker & Containers
Learn Docker: images, containers, Dockerfile

Use Docker in CI to build consistent environments

Optional: Learn Docker Compose

☁️ 8. Deployment Automation
Deploy to:

Web servers (NGINX, Apache)

Cloud (AWS EC2, S3, Lambda)

Kubernetes (optional)

Use tools like Ansible, Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

🔒 9. Security in CI/CD
Secrets management (GitHub Secrets, HashiCorp Vault)

Secure credentials and API tokens

Static code analysis & vulnerability scans

📈 10. Monitoring & Logging
Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

Log monitoring: Ensure post-deploy health checks and error logging

📚 Bonus: Practice Projects
Build a CI/CD pipeline for a sample app:

Frontend (React/Angular)

Backend (Node.js, Django, or Flask)

Deploy to Heroku, Netlify, or AWS
